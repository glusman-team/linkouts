  Id validation on the read path.

  Why: every miss on an arbitrary id is a billed point read (request units are charged for
  404s too), and the id travels into a Cosmos resource URL. Ids that cannot exist must be
  answered locally - zero backend calls, zero request units - and the reserved `__`
  documents must never be fetchable as though they were edges. The Fake backend counts
  every call, so these tests prove the refusal happens before the store.

  # test reseeds, and the call-count assertions below need it undisturbed for their run.
