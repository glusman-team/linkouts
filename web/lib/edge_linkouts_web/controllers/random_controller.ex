  `/random` and `/<kg>/random` answer with an HTTP 302 so an external link can point at them;
  a LiveView would mount a socket and render just to bounce the browser. These are the only
  non-LiveView routes that read data.

  A pick costs point reads only, never a query — the container's indexing policy is `none`, so
  a query would be a full scan at full price (docs/adr/0001-wire-format.md):

  - `/<kg>/random?version=<label>` reads exactly one pool document and picks an id from it.
  - `/<kg>/random` and `/random` read the pool index (counts, no ids), choose a release
    weighted by how many edges it holds, then read that one release's pool.

  Weighting by the true edge count is what keeps "a random edge" uniform over the store: a
  release holding twice the edges is twice as likely to be chosen, and a uniform pick inside
  its reservoir is uniform over those edges. The index is about a kilobyte and a pool is read
  once per node per cache TTL, so serving a thousand randoms costs roughly one read.

  The redirect carries `?version=<key>`, which opens the release the id was sampled from
  rather than whatever the blob's newest version happens to be.

  When there is nothing to pick, the honest answer is a page that says so. Redirecting to `/`
  instead would loop, because `/` is the KG bar that links here.
