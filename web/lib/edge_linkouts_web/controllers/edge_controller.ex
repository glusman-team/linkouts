  The KGX download for one edge document.

  response with a Content-Disposition header, which a LiveView cannot produce for a
  top-level navigation. The body is `Codec.canonical_binary/1` of the resolved document:
  exactly the canonical bytes the CLI would store, so a downloaded file is stable across
  versions, languages and repeated requests.
