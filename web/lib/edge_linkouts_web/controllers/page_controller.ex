  @moduledoc """
  The root of the app is the bar of knowledge graphs this store holds: one row per graph, its
  releases as pills, each pill a random relationship from that release and the row's name a
  random one from any of them.

  The page is one point read of the pool index — counts, no ids, about a kilobyte — so it costs
  roughly 1 RU cold and nothing warm, and it grows by a few bytes per release rather than by a
  document. Nothing here queries the container: its indexing policy is `none`, so a query would
  be a full scan (docs/adr/0001-wire-format.md). Every label, ordering and count is derived on
  the server from that index plus `kgs/*.exs`; nothing derived is stored.

  The legacy KGinfo entry point was `/?id=<uuid>`, and permalinks of that shape still
  circulate in issue trackers and papers, so an `id` parameter here is a redirect to the
  edge page rather than a 404.
