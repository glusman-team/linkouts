defmodule EdgeLinkoutsWeb.Edges do
  @moduledoc """
  The single Cosmos read path for the web app.

  Every page view goes through `fetch_edge/1` exactly once, no matter how many components need
  the document: the LiveView keeps the decoded blob in its assigns, so switching `?version=`
  re-resolves locally and never touches the backend again. `/random` adds two more point reads,
  `fetch_pool_index/0` and `fetch_pool/2`. Reads are coalesced (`Dedupe.execute/3`), so N
  browsers asking for the same id within a millisecond produce one backend call. The RU budget is
  enforced by the transport (`EdgeLinkouts.Cosmos.HTTP`), which knows the real request charge.

  Nothing here queries the container: its indexing policy is `none`, so a query would be a full
  scan billed as such. Every read is by document id, which is 1 RU for a document up to 1 KB.
  """

  alias EdgeLinkouts.{Codec, Cosmos, Dedupe}

  # An edge document may go stale after 30 s without anyone noticing, but the pool index and one
  # release's pool are rewritten only when the CLI loads a release, so their results can be
  # replayed far longer. Fifteen minutes turns "one read per home page view" into "one read per
  # machine per quarter hour" for documents that are under a kilobyte each. Configurable via
  # :pool_ttl_ms (env POOL_TTL_MS).

  One point read of an edge document.

  Returns `{:error, :rate_limited}` for every capacity refusal: the local RU budget is spent, or
  Cosmos answered 429 twice. Other failures pass through from the backend.

  Ids are validated before anything is read. A stored id is a Cosmos document id - at most
  255 bytes, none of `/`, `\\`, `?`, `#` (illegal there), and never the `__` prefix that
  marks the app's own reserved pool documents. Anything else cannot exist, so it answers
  `{:error, :not_found}` without a backend call: malformed scanner traffic must cost zero
  request units, not one per hit.
