defmodule EdgeLinkouts.Display.Segment do
  @moduledoc """
  One piece of rendered linkout output: literal text, or a hyperlink.

  The legacy Perl built HTML by interpolating KG values into strings, so a drug name containing
  `<script>` from an upstream source would execute in a reviewer's browser. This module is the
  fix: the display layer produces *data*, and only the HEEx template turns it into markup, where
  Phoenix escapes by construction.

  Nothing in the display layer may return raw HTML. `to_text/1` exists for the plain-text cases
  (the KGX download, `<title>`, the copy-to-clipboard target) and drops links to their labels.

  A hyperlink, or plain text when the href is unusable.

  A missing or unresolvable CURIE is common in real KGX: the edge points at a node the release

  and an empty label means there is nothing to show at all.

  Concatenates segments, flattening nesting, merging adjacent text runs and dropping nils.

  Flattening matters because the grammar composes: `{:list, ...}` yields a list of rendered
  elements, and a template yields a list per interpolated slot. Without this the links inside a
  list would sit one level deeper than a template walks, and a row would render as nothing.
