defmodule EdgeLinkouts.Dicts do
  @moduledoc """
  The zstd dictionary registry: `%{dictionary_id => dictionary_bytes}` for every `.dict`
  file under `priv/zstd/` (or the directory in `:zstd_dict_dir`).

  Storage format v2 writes each document's blob compressed with a trained dictionary and
  stamps the dictionary's id into the envelope's `d` field. A read resolves the id through
  this registry; an id the app does not know is a loud error, never a guess. The registry
  is keyed by the id embedded in each dictionary's header (bytes 4-8 little-endian after
  the magic `0xEC30A437`), not by filename, so the file on disk cannot disagree with the
  identity it claims.

  Multiple dictionaries coexist - one per KG, or an old and a new training of the same KG -
  which is what makes retraining a drop-in operation: old documents keep decoding against
  the old id for as long as its file ships.

  Loaded once at boot (a `persistent_term` entry); the files are public data derived from
  public knowledge graphs, so carrying them in the release costs nothing and a read never
  touches the filesystem.
