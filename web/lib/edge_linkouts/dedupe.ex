defmodule EdgeLinkouts.Dedupe do
  @moduledoc """
  Collapses concurrent identical reads: one Cosmos read per document id, not one per caller,
  and replays recent successes from `EdgeLinkouts.Cache`.

  Two browsers opening the same edge within a millisecond must produce one backend call.
  `execute/3` makes the first caller the leader, which runs the function; concurrent
  callers for the same id wait and receive the leader's exact result. The result is shared
  by message, not cached: the coalescing half is request dedupe, not an HTTP cache.

  Failure handling:

  - The leader crashing (or its function raising/exiting) notifies waiters, which fall
    through to their own direct call.
  - A waiter's wait is bounded (`:wait_ms`, default 500); on timeout it deregisters and
    calls directly rather than blocking a LiveView forever.
  - Every claim and every waiter is monitored, so a crashed process leaves no entry.

  Recent results:

  A LiveView page view mounts twice, once for the static HTTP render and once for the
  connected process, a few hundred milliseconds apart. Coalescing alone cannot merge those,
  because the first read has finished before the second starts, so every page view would
  cost two Cosmos reads. Successful results are therefore replayed for `:ttl_ms`
  (default 30 s) from the cache named by the `:cache` option (`EdgeLinkouts.Cache` by
  default); a read may pass `:ttl_ms` to override the default, which is how pool documents
  replay for 15 minutes (see the web read path).

  Not-found is also replayed, briefly: `{:error, :not_found}` is kept for
  `:negative_ttl_ms` (default 10 s) so a crawler hammering dead links does not re-spend a
  request unit per hit. The negative ttl is deliberately independent of any caller's
  `:ttl_ms` override - a pool read passing a 15-minute override must not pin a 404 for
  15 minutes. Every other failure - a throttle, an outage - is retried, never replayed.

  The cache is read from the calling process, so the hot path never waits on this
  GenServer; the server only writes, and the write is a synchronous call before the leader
  returns, so a connected mount that follows the static render cannot race past the store.

  Clustering: a caller may pass an MFA tuple instead of a closure. The tuple routes the read
  to the id's owner on the partitioned cache's ring, so the whole cluster shares one
  in-flight read per id; closures stay local (see `execute/4`). Failures to route fall back
  to local execution, so a partition costs an extra read, never an error page. See ADR 0004.

  Runs `fun` once for all concurrent callers that pass the same `id`.

  Returns exactly what `fun` returns. If this process is not the leader, it waits up to
  the configured `:wait_ms` for the leader's result, then calls `fun` itself.

  `opts`:

  - `:ttl_ms` - how long a successful result may be replayed, overriding the server default.
    A read of a document the CLI only rewrites on a load (the pool index, one release's pool)
    can be replayed for minutes without showing anything stale to a person; an edge document
    uses the default, so a page view right after a load shows the release that was just loaded.
    The override is ignored when the server's own `:ttl_ms` is zero, which is how tests turn
    caching off: a caller must not be able to switch it back on behind their back.
