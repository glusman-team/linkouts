defmodule EdgeLinkouts.Cluster do
  @moduledoc """
  Live membership of the app nodes, for the two cluster-aware pieces of the read path.

  Every node joins the `:pg` group `:edge_linkouts_nodes` at boot; the member count is kept
  in an `:atomics` cell so the RU limiter can divide the shared budget by the live cluster
  size on its hot path without a process round trip, and `EdgeLinkouts.Dedupe` can ask the
  partitioned cache's ring where a key lives. `:pg` handles member death and netsplits
  (monitors), so the count tracks reality rather than a static config.

  Single node is the norm (one Fly machine): the group has one member, the count is 1, and
  the limiter divides by 1. Nothing here requires libcluster; libcluster only brings peers
  into the group. The count is read through `:persistent_term` with a fallback of 1, so a
  bare test that starts the limiter without the cluster supervisor sees single-node
  behavior.

  NOT `Node.list/0`: that includes ad-hoc nodes like a `fly ssh console` session, which
  would shrink the per-node budget while holding no traffic.
