defmodule EdgeLinkouts.Cosmos do
  @moduledoc """
  Read-only access to the Cosmos DB edge documents.

  The behaviour has exactly one operation: a point read of one document by id. The web app
  never writes, and never queries: the container's indexing policy is `none`, so a query
  would be a full scan at full price (docs/adr/0001-wire-format.md). The only credential
  configured here is the account's read-only key.

  `get_edge/1` returns the *stored* document (`%{"id" => ..., "b" => ..., "d" => ...}`),
  not a decoded blob: decoding needs the display configuration and the zstd dictionary,
  which is `EdgeLinkouts.Codec`'s concern, not transport's. Its name says "edge" because
  that is what it was written for, but it reads any reserved document id too — the pool
  index and one release's random pool are documents in the same container, which is how
  `/random` stays a point read instead of a query.

  Reserved document ids (`__random_pool__` and friends) never collide with an edge id,
  because an edge id is a UUID and a reserved id starts with two underscores.

  Backends:

  - `EdgeLinkouts.Cosmos.HTTP` - Finch + master-key HMAC, selected in production.
  - `EdgeLinkouts.Cosmos.File` - NDJSON file written by the CLI's file store, for dev.
  - `EdgeLinkouts.Cosmos.Fake` - in-memory, programmable failures, started only in tests.

  The backend is resolved per call from `config :edge_linkouts, :cosmos_backend` so tests
  can swap it without recompiling.

  (`cosmos.IsReservedID`), which is what lets a test split a fixture file into edges and
  metadata without knowing the naming scheme twice.
