defmodule EdgeLinkouts.RateLimiter do
  @moduledoc """
  RU budget for the web app: a sliding one-second window over `:atomics`.

  The free tier is 1000 RU/s shared with the CLI (which gets the 75% burst budget); the
  web app is budgeted at `RU_BUDGET_WEB` (default 150). Two operations per Cosmos call:

  - `allow?/2` before the call, from an estimate - refuses with `false` when the current
    window cannot fit it, so the caller returns "rate limited" instead of blocking.
  - `charge/2` after the response, with the *actual* `x-ms-request-charge` (Cosmos bills
    404s and 429s too, and a refused request is charged nothing).

  On a cluster the limiter stays per-node and the budget is divided by the live node count
  (`EdgeLinkouts.Cluster.node_count/0`, one atomics read): the strict total is
  RU_BUDGET_WEB at any N, with no cross-node coordination to fail. A node join or leave
  briefly mis-splits by a window at worst.

  The window is not a leaky bucket: a burst spends its budget and is blocked for at most
  one second, never forever. The window state is one packed 64-bit atomics word
  (window start milliseconds in the high 32 bits, RU spent in the low 32), updated with
  compare-and-exchange so concurrent readers cannot lose charges; the rejected counter is
  a second cell. No GenServer round trip on the hot path - the GenServer only owns the
  ref's lifecycle. The clock is injectable (`:now_fun`) so throttle tests do not sleep.
