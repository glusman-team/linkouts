// reservoir is a thread-safe Algorithm R sample with deduplication.

// It exists because indexing is off on this container: picking a random edge with a query
// would be a full cross-partition scan, so the CLI samples ids while it streams (free, it is
// already touching every document) and the app point-reads the result. Uniformity matters —
// /random is how a reviewer stumbles onto an edge they were not looking for, and a sample
// biased toward the front of the file would only ever show one predicate.

// the cap is 4096). /random picks uniformly from the list, so order carries no meaning.
